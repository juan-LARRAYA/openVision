# OpenVision - Environment Variables Example
#
# This project currently doesn't require environment variables.
# All AI models run client-side in the browser.
#
# If you add features that need environment variables in the future,
# follow Vite's convention and prefix them with VITE_
# Example: VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
